For running the preprocessing file give the directory where the html files are stored as the first argument and the attached stopword.csv file path as the second argument. This will create content.csv and label.csv.
The files which you get from datapre.py should be read for running Visualisation.py and approaches.py.
If the Datapre.py step is skipped you can read the attached csv files viz, content.csv and label.csv.
Note: content.csv and label.csv should be present in the same folder of the .py files.
